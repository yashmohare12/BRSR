## 📊 Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Small IT Company
**Company Profile:**
- 100 employees
- Revenue: ₹50 Crores
- Office operations only

**Annual Consumption:**
- Diesel (generators): 5,000 L
- Electricity: 200,000 kWh
- Air Travel: 50,000 km
- Paper: 1,000 kg

**Calculations:**
```
Scope 1 (Diesel):     5,000 × 2.68    = 13,400 kg CO₂e    = 13.4 tonnes
Scope 2 (Electricity): 200,000 × 0.82  = 164,000 kg CO₂e   = 164 tonnes
Scope 3 (Travel):     50,000 × 0.255  = 12,750 kg CO₂e    = 12.75 tonnes
Scope 3 (Paper):      1,000 × 0.91    = 910 kg CO₂e       = 0.91 tonnes

Total Emissions: 191.06 tonnes CO₂e
Emission Intensity: 191.06 / 50 = 3.82 tCO₂e/₹Cr
```

### Example 2: Manufacturing Company
**Company Profile:**
- 500 employees
- Revenue: ₹500 Crores
- Manufacturing facility

**Annual Consumption:**
- Diesel: 50,000 L
- Natural Gas: 100,000 m³
- Electricity: 5,000,000 kWh
- Coal: 500 tonnes

**Calculations:**
```
Scope 1:
- Diesel:      50,000 × 2.68     = 134,000 kg CO₂e   = 134 tonnes
- Natural Gas: 100,000 × 2.03    = 203,000 kg CO₂e   = 203 tonnes
- Coal:        500 × 2,419       = 1,209,500 kg CO₂e = 1,209.5 tonnes

Scope 2:
- Electricity: 5,000,000 × 0.82  = 4,100,000 kg CO₂e = 4,100 tonnes

Total Emissions: 5,646.5 tonnes CO₂e
Emission Intensity: 5,646.5 / 500 = 11.29 tCO₂e/₹Cr
```
